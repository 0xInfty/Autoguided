# SCID
Synthetic Curation as Implicit Distillation

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Create and activate a Python environment, using commands such as...

    ```
    conda create -n SCID python
    conda activate SCID
    ```

2. Install all required packages using the installation script
    
    ```yes | . install.sh```

3. Verify you have GPU support, by running...

    ```python -c "import torch; print([torch.cuda.get_device_name(i) for i in range(torch.cuda.device_count())])"```

### Managing directories

PyVDirs can manage your directories in such a way that allows you to work from multiple PCs without modifying the code at all.

For PyVDirs to work, you will need to create a new entry inside the `dirs.json` index. This can be done automatically, just by importing the module:

```python
import pyvdirs.dirs as dirs
```

The new entry should look like...

```json
 "your-PC-user-identifier": 
    {"system_name": "UKN", 
     "system_home": "path/to/code/FilteringNSD", 
     "data_home": "path/to/code/FilteringNSD/data", 
     "models_home": "path/to/code/FilteringNSD/models", 
     "results_home": "path/to/code/FilteringNSD/results"}, 
```

Following this index...
- Any datasets and pre-trained models will be stored inside `data_home`
- Any training model checkpoints will be stored inside `models_home`
- Any results will be stored inside `results_home`

You can manually open the file and change the `system_name` attribute to create your own nickname, to know which one is your entry. You can also manually modify each of the other path variables.

### Running the toy model

This repository contains a working adaptation of the toy model from Karras et al's ["Guiding a diffusion model with a bad version of itself"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02507).

Pre-trained toy models can be automatically downloaded and tested running...

```
python ToyExample/toy_example.py plot
```

New toy models can be trained and visualized running...

```
python ToyExample/toy_example.py train
```
